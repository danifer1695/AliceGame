		{"Cheshire_02", "Cheshire Cat: That's all for now - but if you happen to stumble upon any treasure in your little wanderings, do bring it to me. I do so love a good trinket, and I might just have something useful to offer in return."},
		{"Cheshire_03", "Cheshire Cat: A wonderful gift, little child."},
		{"Cheshire_04", "Cheshire Cat: Such delightful treasures you've brought me! A fair trade is only fitting. Here - this should be just the thing to see you out of your little predicament once and for all."},

		{"Bill_01", "Bill: Blimey, ain't you that lass what knocked back that daft growin' potion? Last time I saw ye, you were taller than this whole bleedin' castle! Well, you best keep yer wits about ye - there's guards patrollin' the Staff Hallway. If you gotta get through, have a wee peek through the keyhole first. If ye spot a guard, just wait 'til he toddles off somewhere else."},
		{"Bill_02", "Bill: Well, you best keep yer wits about ye - there's guards patrollin' the Staff Hallway, and their long and sharp spears mean bussiness! Wait around 'till he's off somewhere else, or better still, get him to drink one of them beverages they fancy so much. Makes them sleepy like summer pups!"},
		{"Dodo_01", "Dodo: Oh dear, oh dear! A short rest would be most agreeable - essential, even! But alas, regulations are regulations, and no member of staff may pause, sit, lounge, loiter, dawdle, or otherwise cease activity without the proper authorization. A Break Permit, you see, from the esteemed and most formidable Staff Master. No permit, no pause! Dreadfully inconvenient, I must say."},
		{"Fox_01", "Fox: Now then! How'd a little pipsqueak like you manage to slip out? Ah, no need to tell me - I ain't one for askin' questions. But since you're out, I've got a bit of a deal for ya. See, I've got a proper sweet tooth, and all they give us 'ere is stale crackers and cold tea. So if you find any sweets out there, be a good lass and bring 'em my way, eh? I'll make it worth your while... heh heh heh."},

		{"Fox_03", "Fox: Ah, now we're talkin'! Hand it over, then - this'll do nicely."},
		{"Fox_04", "Fox: Aye, that's more like it! It'll make my stay in this cell just a wee bit sweeter, heh. As promised, here's a little something for your troubles."}
